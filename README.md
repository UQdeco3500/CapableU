## How to Run The Prototype
_Please note detailed screenshots and recordings are avaliable on the wiki page linked above, in case the prototype cannnot easily be built and run locally_
Our final prototype is built as a native iOS application, as such there are some specific requirements for the application to be built and demoed.
### Requirements:
- A Mac running macOS Ventura 13.5 or later
- Xcode 15 or later with iOS and iPadOS SDKs
### Steps
1. Clone our repo, navigating to the CapableU folder in the root.
2. Open the CapableU.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
3. Ensure the run destination is set to iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (6th generation)
   - Note: A properly-configured physical device can also be used.
4. Click Run, or press âŒ˜R
